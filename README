This project is attempt to recover lost joy of debugging.

Few ideas of joyful debugging:

1. CPU executes Assembly. If you can debug without assembly, you
probably can get along without debugger altogether, with just
using logging and diagnostic output (which are important part of
any program).

2. You should always see what you're debugging, without need
to execute jerky commands and stuff. Per p.1, that means seeing
all of: source, assembly, and registers (well, source is optional,
because it's not always present).

3. Executing trivial commands like stepping in/thru should be again
not a jerky commands, but a single keypress.

4. Everyone has different requirements and habbits, so debugger
should be be ultra-hackable (like, you adjust it for yourself in
5 minutes). That means no funky languages like "Cee" and
"Cee-Cross-Cross".

That's it, and this app tries to implement these ideas. It uses gdb
underneath to support multitude of targets. Written in Python.
