Ordered based on rough priority.

1. Add menu so users have an idea what command available on which keys.
2. Add YAML-based session config, support multiple configs.
3. Allow user to specify which registers and in which order to show.
   Because gdb's default is sorted by numeric id, and that's pretty arbitrary.
   Also, it has byte vs word vs dword registers repeated.
4. Highlight updated registers on execution stop.
5. Allow to select disasm syntax flavor via config.
6. Allow to override key bindings via session config.
7, Scroll up (to lower addresses) in disasm pane.
8. Allow to show arbitrary address (including symbols) in disasm pane.
9. Show backtrace.
10. Show memory.
11. Edit registers.
12. Edit memory.
13. Execute arbitrary GDB command.
14. Filter/show debugee stdout output (that's deep problem with GDB/MI).
